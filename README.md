# Rainbow Functions

This is the functions component of Rainbow :rainbow:, an implementation of Amazon Lambda for local development.

## Questions

* What's Rainbow?

A future project for local implementation of Amazon AWS services.

* Why not LocalStack?

LocalStack is great when your function is self-contained and already developed, but I wanted something that supported Lambda
Layers (without a subscription) and first-class support for reloading functions as they are edited.

* Why not Serverless?

Serverless seems great, but most of my development has already been in Terraform.
